Hello there! My name is Panagiotis, and I'm a web developer with a passion for creating clean, functional, and visually appealing websites. I've had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, from simple landing pages to complex web applications.

My expertise lies in front-end development, and I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have experience working with several front-end frameworks, including React and Vue, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.

When I'm not coding, you can find me on the basketball court coaching my team or out for a walk . I believe that a balanced lifestyle is essential for productivity and creativity, and I strive to maintain that balance in both my personal and professional life.

If you're looking for a dedicated, detail-oriented, and passionate web developer, look no further! Let's work together to bring your vision to life.
